This is a example of 2 different microservices  in-memory database. 

Currently using in-memory database(H2), latter will try to switch to MySQL database

Learned from this link https://www.javaguides.net/2024/05/angular-spring-boot-microservices.html


Service Registry: Manages service discovery.

API Gateway: Routes client requests to appropriate microservices.

Employee Service: Manages employee data.
